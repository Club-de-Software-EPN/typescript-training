# Introduction to JavaScript

"JavaScript (JS) is a **lightweight**, **interpreted**, or **just-in-time compiled** programming language with first-class functions. " [[1]](#1).

> Lightweight: With sumple syntax and semantics, designed to have small memory footprint.

> Interpreted: JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. 

> Just-in-time compiled: More modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

- JavaScript is the scripting language for Web pages and other many non-browser environments.
-  This language is closer to a dynamically-typed, interpreted language such as Python or Ruby.

## History 

- The language was created to allow web developers to embed executable code on their webpages, so that they could make their webpages interactive, or perform simple tasks.
- JavaScript started at Netscape, a web browser developed in the 1990s [[2]](#2).

- As a response JavaScript 1.0's release, Netscape and Sun, together with the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), set about standardizing the language [[3]](#3).
- The first official standard specification for the language was issued in 1997 under the name ECMAScript.
-  Over the course of seven years the committee developed major enhancements to the language and its specification. The result, known as ECMAScript 2015, is the foundation for the ongoing evolution of JavaScript [[4]](#4).
